# Lesson: How to Write a Good Cover Letter

## 1. Introduction: Why are you writing?
- Clearly state the job you are applying for (job title and type of contract: internship, part-time, full-time, etc.).
  - Example: "I am applying for the position of Marketing Assistant (full-time) at your company."
- Mention where you found the job offer (website, referral, etc.).
  - Example: "I found your job posting on LinkedIn."
- Indicate when you are available to start and, if it’s an internship, the desired duration.
  - Example: "I am available to start from July 1st, and I am looking for a six-month internship."
- Let the employer know your CV/resume is attached (you can also mention this in your closing paragraph).
  - Example: "Please find my resume attached for your consideration."

## 2. Highlight your strengths
- Present your relevant qualifications and skills for the position.
  - Example: "With a degree in Computer Science and experience in web development, I am confident in my ability to contribute to your team."
- Explain why you are interested in this type of work.
  - Example: "I am passionate about digital marketing and eager to develop my skills in a dynamic environment."
- Show your motivation for the company: why do you want to work there? (If it’s a small company, you can say you appreciate a friendly, close-knit team.)
  - Example: "I am particularly drawn to your company’s innovative approach and collaborative culture."
- Mention any dates when you are or are not available for an interview.
  - Example: "I am available for an interview at your convenience, except on Fridays."

## 3. Conclusion
- Thank the recruiter for their attention.
  - Example: "Thank you for considering my application."
- Remind them that your CV/resume is attached.
  - Example: "My resume is attached for your review."
- Express your motivation to meet them in an interview.
  - Example: "I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my application with you in person."
- End with an appropriate closing phrase.
  - Example: "Yours sincerely,"
